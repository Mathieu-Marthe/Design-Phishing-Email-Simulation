As an analyst in our Security Awareness Team, our Chief Security Officer (CSO) relies on our team to help our staff learn how to identify and report security threats to Mastercard.

One of the most common threats organizations face today is phishing. So, what is phishing?
- Phishing is the act of pretending to be someone/something to get information, in most cases, this is usually a password.
- Attackers may send links or attachments designed to infect the recipient's system with malicious software or lure them into providing financial information, system credentials or other sensitive data.
- Successful phishing attempts can cost companies like Mastercard millions of dollars and put our employees at risk. So it’s very important that we keep the business and our staff safe from harm.

At Mastercard, one of the ways we mitigate phishing threats is by educating our people about the risks and how to identify them. An effective way to build awareness is through phishing simulation campaigns:
- We test our staff every month by sending a fake phishing email that is made to look like something a bad actor would send.
- We use the results of the simulated test to help us design and implement future training.

## What can a phishing email look like?

A few months back, we detected a phishing email that was being used by an external bad actor on some of our employees.

Thankfully, it failed due to being an obvious fake. However, we know that phishing emails are now getting very sophisticated and a range of tactics are used.

Start the quick quiz to learn what an ‘obvious fake’ might look like.

### What is the first issue you spot in this phishing email?
Suspicious source email address 

### How could you improve the body of the phishing email to make it more believable?
Improve the grammar, spelling and sloppy layout

## The task is to create a believable phishing email

Your manager wants you to lead Mastercard’s next phishing simulation campaign. This is an awesome opportunity for you to step up and show what you can do.

The first step is to create the fake phishing email to use in the simulation.

You’ve just seen what an ‘obvious fake’ looks like, so it’s important to make yours contextual and believable to increase the likelihood of an employee clicking on the phishing link.

### Improve the phishing email

Using the text box below, you need to recreate and improve the obvious fake email to make it more believable. Remember the end goal is to encourage the user to click on the link.

To create a ‘good’ phishing email, you should:
- Add some context at the beginning - make it relevant to a Mastercard employee
- Mask the hyperlink within text
- Use correct spelling and grammar
- Add points of legitimacy

Once you've submitted your email, we'll show you an example of a good phishing email.

Here is the obvious fake:

## My Improved Version:

Dear [Employee Name],

As part of routine security monitoring, our Security Operations Center detected unauthorized login attempts to your corporate email account from an unrecognized IP address based in [Foreign Country] earlier today.

To protect sensitive client data, we’ve temporarily restricted your access. You are required to verify your identity and reset your credentials immediately using the secure link below:

[RESET CREDENTIALS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing)

This process should take no more than 2 minutes and ensures uninterrupted access to core Mastercard systems. Failure to act may result in your account being locked.
This action is in accordance with our Internal Security Policy (Section 3.2 – User Credential Management) and is mandatory for all affected users.

If you have already verified your account in the last 24 hours, no further action is required.

Sincerely,

Mastercard Security Team
